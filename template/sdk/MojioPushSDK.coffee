MojioRestSDK = require './MojioRestSDK'
# The Push segment of the Mojio SDK. The Push segement of the SDK provides a mechanism for applications to subscribe
# to changes occurring on primary API resources of Vehicles, Users, Mojios, Trips, Groups, and Apps.
#
# Mojio maintains a separate "Push" style API where applications can subscribe to changes on resources and receive those
# changes across multiple transports.  Current transports include: SIGNALR, HTTPS POST, and MQTT.
#
# Subscriptions are instantiated by posting "Observers" to the Push API's REST interface.  Observers define what, when
# and how data is channeled to the application from the server.
#
# What is defined by specification of the resource type and id.
# The "What" delivered can be narrowed down to a specific set of fields through a filter specification (basically a list of the names of the fields).
#
# The "When" is defined by optional conditions, debounce, throttle, and timings.
#
# The "How" is defined by a transport specification
# that has the connection details to a method, server or hub, depending on the transport type.  For SignalR, Mojio provides
# the hub of communication, for other protocols like MQTT or Http Post, the application writer is responsible for the
# communication infrastructure.
#
#
# The inheritance path is:
#    MojioPushSDK->MojioRestSDK->MojioAuthSDK->MojioModelSDK
#
#
# @example
#   mojioSdk = new MojioSDK({sdk: MojioPushSDK}) # instantiate the mojioSDK to all available API calls.
#
